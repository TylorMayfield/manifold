# Backup & Restore System Cleanup

## Overview

The backup and restore system has been completely cleaned up and modernized to use the new Prisma-based SQLite architecture. This cleanup addresses multiple issues with the previous implementation and provides a unified, type-safe, and maintainable solution.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Multiple Conflicting Services**

**Before:**

- `S3BackupService` - Cloud backup functionality
- `LocalBackupService` - Local backup with localStorage fallback
- `BackupJobService` - Job-based backup system
- `PrismaBackupService` - New Prisma-based service
- `BackupScheduler` - Scheduled backup functionality

**After:**

- `UnifiedBackupService` - Single service handling all backup operations
- `BackupJobService` - Internal job management (used by UnifiedBackupService)
- Clean separation of concerns

### 2. **Inconsistent APIs**

**Before:** Different services had different method signatures, return types, and error handling patterns.

**After:** Unified API with consistent:

- Method signatures
- Return types (`BackupMetadata`, `RestoreResult`, `BackupStats`)
- Error handling
- TypeScript types

### 3. **Mixed Storage Systems**

**Before:** `LocalBackupService` used localStorage as fallback instead of proper SQLite.

**After:** All backups use the Prisma SQLite system with proper database storage.

### 4. **Complex UI Logic**

**Before:** `BackupRestorePage` had business logic mixed with UI components.

**After:** Clean separation with:

- `UnifiedBackupService` - Business logic
- `BackupRestorePageClean` - Clean UI component
- `BackupManagerV2` - Simplified backup manager

### 5. **Incomplete Integration**

**Before:** New Prisma services weren't fully integrated with the UI.

**After:** Complete integration with proper error handling and user feedback.

## New Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. `UnifiedBackupService`

```typescript
class UnifiedBackupService {
  // Create backups
  async createBackup(project, dataSources, options): Promise<string>;

  // Manage backups
  async getBackups(projectId): Promise<BackupMetadata[]>;
  async getBackup(backupId, projectId): Promise<BackupMetadata | null>;
  async deleteBackup(backupId, projectId): Promise<void>;

  // Restore functionality
  async restoreFromBackup(backupId, projectId, options): Promise<RestoreResult>;

  // Job management
  async getBackupJobs(projectId): Promise<Job[]>;
  async getBackupJobStatus(jobId): Promise<Job | null>;
  async cancelBackupJob(jobId): Promise<boolean>;

  // Statistics
  async getBackupStats(projectId): Promise<BackupStats>;

  // System status
  async isAvailable(): Promise<boolean>;
  getSupportedTypes(): BackupType[];
}
```

#### 2. `BackupJobService` (Internal)

- Handles job creation and execution
- Manages backup file generation (CSV, SQLite, Full JSON)
- Provides progress tracking and status updates

#### 3. UI Components

##### `BackupRestorePageClean`

- Clean, modern UI with glass effects
- Tabbed interface (Backup, Restore, Settings)
- Real-time status updates
- Proper error handling and user feedback

##### `BackupManagerV2`

- Simplified backup manager for integration
- Modal-based backup management
- Clean, focused interface

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Type Safety**

- Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- Compile-time type checking
- Auto-generated types from Prisma

### 2. **Unified API**

- Single service for all backup operations
- Consistent method signatures
- Standardized error handling

### 3. **Better User Experience**

- Real-time status updates
- Progress indicators
- Clear error messages
- Intuitive interface

### 4. **Proper Database Integration**

- Uses Prisma SQLite system
- No more localStorage fallbacks
- Proper data persistence

### 5. **Job-Based System**

- Asynchronous backup creation
- Progress tracking
- Job status monitoring
- Cancellation support

### 6. **Multiple Backup Formats**

- **Full Backup**: Complete project backup with all data
- **SQLite Export**: Export project database as SQLite file
- **CSV Export**: Export project data as CSV files

## Migration Guide

### For Components Using Old Services

**Before:**

```typescript
import { S3BackupService } from "./lib/services/S3BackupService";
import { LocalBackupService } from "./lib/services/LocalBackupService";

const s3Service = S3BackupService.getInstance();
const localService = LocalBackupService.getInstance();
```

**After:**

```typescript
import { UnifiedBackupService } from "./lib/services/UnifiedBackupService";

const backupService = UnifiedBackupService.getInstance();
```

### For Backup Operations

**Before:**

```typescript
// Multiple different APIs
await s3Service.backupProject(project, dataSources, description);
await localService.backupProject(project, dataSources, description);
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Single unified API
await backupService.createBackup(project, dataSources, {
  type: "full",
  description: "Manual backup",
  includeData: true,
});
```

### For Restore Operations

**Before:**

```typescript
// Different restore methods
const result = await s3Service.restoreProject(backupId, projectId);
const result = await localService.restoreProject(backupId, projectId);
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Single restore method
const result = await backupService.restoreFromBackup(backupId, projectId, {
  overwriteExisting: true,
  restoreSnapshots: true,
});
```

## File Structure

```
lib/services/
├── UnifiedBackupService.ts      # Main backup service
├── BackupJobService.ts          # Internal job management
└── PrismaBackupService.ts       # Legacy (can be removed)

components/backup/
├── BackupRestorePageClean.tsx   # New clean UI
├── BackupManagerV2.tsx          # Simplified manager
├── BackupRestorePage.tsx        # Legacy (can be updated)
└── BackupManager.tsx            # Legacy (can be updated)
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Single service to maintain instead of multiple conflicting services
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
3. **Performance**: Optimized SQLite operations with Prisma
4. **User Experience**: Clean, intuitive interface with real-time updates
5. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and status tracking
6. **Scalability**: Job-based system can handle large backups
7. **Flexibility**: Multiple backup formats and options

## Next Steps

1. **Update Existing Components**: Replace old backup service usage with `UnifiedBackupService`
2. **Remove Legacy Services**: Clean up old backup services that are no longer needed
3. **Add More Features**: Implement additional backup options and restore capabilities
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for the new backup system
5. **Documentation**: Update user documentation with new backup features

## Testing

The new system should be tested with:

- Project creation and backup
- Different backup types (CSV, SQLite, Full)
- Restore operations
- Error handling scenarios
- Large dataset backups
- Job cancellation
- System availability checks

This cleanup provides a solid foundation for reliable backup and restore functionality in the Manifold application.
